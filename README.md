# Reverse an Array
Whiteboarding done with James Dansie. Actual code written solo by Sharina Stubbs.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray that takes an array as an argument and returns an array with elements in reversed order. Avoids any built-in language specific methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I decided to approach this problem with creating a new array, instead of the other option I had considered, which was to change the array in place. I chose the new array approach since it made the most sense to me initially, however creating a new array would sacrifice memory. 

Big 0 time - O(n)
Big 0 space - 0(n)
