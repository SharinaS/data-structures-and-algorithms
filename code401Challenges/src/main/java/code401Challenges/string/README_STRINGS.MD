# My Solutions for Code Challenges Involving Strings
The following are code challenges supplied by either CodingBat or Leetcode. 

If there is no link to the code, the code has not yet been written up in an IDE, and only exists in the image I have attached for that particular code challenge. 

# String Echoes
## Problem Domain
Given a string and a non-negative integer, return a larger string that is n copies of the original string. If n=0, return empty string.

## Thoughts
This is a simple question that is a nice brain "warmup." Code is not yet available except on attached image.

## Time and Space Analysis
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

# Find the String "code" in a string
## Problem Domain
Return the number of times the string "code" appears anywhere in the given string, except any letter for 'd' is accepted... so "cope" and "cooe", etc, count. 

## Thoughts
This code challenge is nice practice to use str.charAt(), and to practice how to use it in a for loop.
