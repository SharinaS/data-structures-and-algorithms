### Problem Domain
Given a string and a non-negative integer, return a larger string that is n copies of the original string. If n=0, return empty string.

### Thoughts
This is a simple question that is a nice brain "warmup." Code is not yet available except on attached image.

### Time and Space Analysis
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)
